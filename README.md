Wee! Restaurant reviews!
[A React.js JavaScript project from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)... the original assignment was on Angular controllers, directives, bindings, filters, and more, but I chose to do this project in React.js instead.

This application needs a server to run. A small server has been provided which can access the fake API (json files included in this repo). To run the server locally:
```sh
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

The application will be at localhost:3000.

To access the second part of the assignment on photos, go to [this separate repo](https://github.com/siakaramalegos/react-photos).
